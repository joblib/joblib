Development
-----------

Olivier Grisel

    Make Memory.cache robust to PermissionError (errno 13) under Windows
    when run in combination with Parallel.

    Make it possible to hint for thread-based parallelism with
    ``prefer='threads'`` or enforce shared-memory semantics with
    ``require='sharedmem'``.


Release 0.11
------------

Alexandre Abadie

    Remove support for python 2.6

Alexandre Abadie

    Remove deprecated `format_signature`, `format_call` and `load_output`
    functions from Memory API.

Loïc Estève

    Add initial implementation of LRU cache cleaning. You can specify
    the size limit of a ``Memory`` object via the ``bytes_limit``
    parameter and then need to clean explicitly the cache via the
    ``Memory.reduce_size`` method.

Olivier Grisel

    Make the multiprocessing backend work even when the name of the main
    thread is not the Python default. Thanks to Roman Yurchak for the
    suggestion.

Karan Desai

    pytest is used to run the tests instead of nosetests.
    ``python setup.py test`` or ``python setup.py nosetests`` do not work
    anymore, run ``pytest joblib`` instead.

Loïc Estève

    An instance of ``joblib.ParallelBackendBase`` can be passed into
    the ``parallel`` argument in ``joblib.Parallel``.


Loïc Estève

    Fix handling of memmap objects with offsets greater than
    mmap.ALLOCATIONGRANULARITY in ``joblib.Parrallel``. See
    https://github.com/joblib/joblib/issues/451 for more details.

Loïc Estève

    Fix performance regression in ``joblib.Parallel`` with
    n_jobs=1. See https://github.com/joblib/joblib/issues/483 for more
    details.

Loïc Estève

    Fix race condition when a function cached with
    ``joblib.Memory.cache`` was used inside a ``joblib.Parallel``. See
    https://github.com/joblib/joblib/issues/490 for more details.

Release 0.10.3
--------------

Loïc Estève

    Fix tests when multiprocessing is disabled via the
    JOBLIB_MULTIPROCESSING environment variable.

harishmk

    Remove warnings in nested Parallel objects when the inner Parallel
    has n_jobs=1. See https://github.com/joblib/joblib/pull/406 for
    more details.

Release 0.10.2
--------------

Loïc Estève

    FIX a bug in stack formatting when the error happens in a compiled
    extension. See https://github.com/joblib/joblib/pull/382 for more
    details.

Vincent Latrouite

    FIX a bug in the constructor of BinaryZlibFile that would throw an
    exception when passing unicode filename (Python 2 only).
    See https://github.com/joblib/joblib/pull/384 for more details.

Olivier Grisel

    Expose :class:`joblib.parallel.ParallelBackendBase` and
    :class:`joblib.parallel.AutoBatchingMixin` in the public API to
    make them officially re-usable by backend implementers.


Release 0.10.0
--------------

Alexandre Abadie

    ENH: joblib.dump/load now accept file-like objects besides filenames.
    https://github.com/joblib/joblib/pull/351 for more details.

Niels Zeilemaker and Olivier Grisel

    Refactored joblib.Parallel to enable the registration of custom
    computational backends.
    https://github.com/joblib/joblib/pull/306
    Note the API to register custom backends is considered experimental
    and subject to change without deprecation.

Alexandre Abadie

    Joblib pickle format change: joblib.dump always create a single pickle file
    and joblib.dump/joblib.save never do any memory copy when writing/reading
    pickle files. Reading pickle files generated with joblib versions prior
    to 0.10 will be supported for a limited amount of time, we advise to
    regenerate them from scratch when convenient.
    joblib.dump and joblib.load also support pickle files compressed using
    various strategies: zlib, gzip, bz2, lzma and xz. Note that lzma and xz are
    only available with python >= 3.3.
    https://github.com/joblib/joblib/pull/260 for more details.

Antony Lee

    ENH: joblib.dump/load now accept pathlib.Path objects as filenames.
    https://github.com/joblib/joblib/pull/316 for more details.

Olivier Grisel

    Workaround for "WindowsError: [Error 5] Access is denied" when trying to
    terminate a multiprocessing pool under Windows:
    https://github.com/joblib/joblib/issues/354


Release 0.9.4
-------------

Olivier Grisel

    FIX a race condition that could cause a joblib.Parallel to hang
    when collecting the result of a job that triggers an exception.
    https://github.com/joblib/joblib/pull/296

Olivier Grisel

    FIX a bug that caused joblib.Parallel to wrongly reuse previously
    memmapped arrays instead of creating new temporary files.
    https://github.com/joblib/joblib/pull/294 for more details.

Loïc Estève

    FIX for raising non inheritable exceptions in a Parallel call. See
    https://github.com/joblib/joblib/issues/269 for more details.

Alexandre Abadie

    FIX joblib.hash error with mixed types sets and dicts containing mixed
    types keys when using Python 3.
    see https://github.com/joblib/joblib/issues/254

Loïc Estève

    FIX joblib.dump/load for big numpy arrays with dtype=object. See
    https://github.com/joblib/joblib/issues/220 for more details.

Loïc Estève

    FIX joblib.Parallel hanging when used with an exhausted
    iterator. See https://github.com/joblib/joblib/issues/292 for more
    details.

Release 0.9.3
-------------

Olivier Grisel

    Revert back to the ``fork`` start method (instead of
    ``forkserver``) as the latter was found to cause crashes in
    interactive Python sessions.

Release 0.9.2
-------------

Loïc Estève

    Joblib hashing now uses the default pickle protocol (2 for Python
    2 and 3 for Python 3). This makes it very unlikely to get the same
    hash for a given object under Python 2 and Python 3.

    In particular, for Python 3 users, this means that the output of
    joblib.hash changes when switching from joblib 0.8.4 to 0.9.2 . We
    strive to ensure that the output of joblib.hash does not change
    needlessly in future versions of joblib but this is not officially
    guaranteed.

Loïc Estève

    Joblib pickles generated with Python 2 can not be loaded with
    Python 3 and the same applies for joblib pickles generated with
    Python 3 and loaded with Python 2.

    During the beta period 0.9.0b2 to 0.9.0b4, we experimented with
    a joblib serialization that aimed to make pickles serialized with
    Python 3 loadable under Python 2. Unfortunately this serialization
    strategy proved to be too fragile as far as the long-term
    maintenance was concerned (For example see
    https://github.com/joblib/joblib/pull/243). That means that joblib
    pickles generated with joblib 0.9.0bN can not be loaded under
    joblib 0.9.2. Joblib beta testers, who are the only ones likely to
    be affected by this, are advised to delete their joblib cache when
    they upgrade from 0.9.0bN to 0.9.2.

Arthur Mensch

    Fixed a bug with ``joblib.hash`` that used to return unstable values for
    strings and numpy.dtype instances depending on interning states.

Olivier Grisel

    Make joblib use the 'forkserver' start method by default under Python 3.4+
    to avoid causing crash with 3rd party libraries (such as Apple vecLib /
    Accelerate or the GCC OpenMP runtime) that use an internal thread pool that
    is not not reinitialized when a ``fork`` system call happens.

Olivier Grisel

    New context manager based API (``with`` block) to re-use
    the same pool of workers across consecutive parallel calls.

Vlad Niculae and Olivier Grisel

    Automated batching of fast tasks into longer running jobs to
    hide multiprocessing dispatching overhead when possible.

Olivier Grisel

    FIX make it possible to call ``joblib.load(filename, mmap_mode='r')``
    on pickled objects that include a mix of arrays of both
    memory memmapable dtypes and object dtype.


Release 0.8.4
-------------

2014-11-20
Olivier Grisel

    OPTIM use the C-optimized pickler under Python 3

    This makes it possible to efficiently process parallel jobs that deal with
    numerous Python objects such as large dictionaries.

-------------

2014-08-19
Olivier Grisel

2014-08-07
Lars Buitinck

    MAINT NumPy 1.10-safe version comparisons


2014-07-11
Olivier Grisel

    FIX #146: Heisen test failure caused by thread-unsafe Python lists

    This fix uses a queue.Queue datastructure in the failing test. This
    datastructure is thread-safe thanks to an internal Lock. This Lock instance
    not picklable hence cause the picklability check of delayed to check fail.

    When using the threading backend, picklability is no longer required, hence
    this PRs give the user the ability to disable it on a case by case basis.


Release 0.8.2
-------------

2014-06-30
Olivier Grisel

    BUG: use mmap_mode='r' by default in Parallel and MemmappingPool

    The former default of mmap_mode='c' (copy-on-write) caused
    problematic use of the paging file under Windows.

Date:   2013-11-08
