Getting the latest code
=========================

To get the latest code using git, simply type::

    git clone git://github.com/joblib/joblib.git

If you don't have git installed, you can download a zip or tarball
of the latest code: http://github.com/joblib/joblib/archives/master

Installing
=========================

You can use `pip` to install joblib::

    pip install joblib

from any directory or

    python setup.py install

from the source directory.

Joblib has no other mandatory dependency than Python (supported
versions are 2.7+ and 3.4+). Numpy (at least version 1.6.1) is an
optional dependency for array manipulation.

Workflow to contribute
=========================

To contribute to joblib, first create an account on `github
<http://github.com/>`_. Once this is done, fork the `joblib repository
<http://github.com/joblib/joblib>`_ to have you own repository,
clone it using 'git clone' on the computers where you want to work. Make
your changes in your clone, push them to your github account, test them
on several computers, and when you are happy with them, send a pull
request to the main repository.

Running the test suite
=========================

To run the test suite, you need the pytest (version >= 3) and coverage modules.
Run the test suite using::

    pytest joblib

from the root of the project.

Building the docs
=========================

To build the docs you need to have setuptools and sphinx (>=0.5) installed.
Run the command::

    python setup.py build_sphinx

The docs are built in the build/sphinx/html directory.


Making a source tarball
=========================

To create a source tarball, eg for packaging or distributing, run the
following command::

    python setup.py sdist

The tarball will be created in the `dist` directory. This command will
compile the docs, and the resulting tarball can be installed with
no extra dependencies than the Python standard library. You will need
setuptool and sphinx.

Making a release and uploading it to PyPI
==================================================

This command is only run by project manager, to make a release, and
upload in to PyPI::

    python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel upload_docs --upload-dir build/sphinx/html
    twine upload dist/*

Updating the changelog
========================

Changes are listed in the CHANGES.rst file. They must be manually updated
but, the following git command may be used to generate the lines::

    git log --abbrev-commit --date=short --no-merges --sparse
