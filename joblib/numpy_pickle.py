# Utility functions

def dump(value, filename, compress=0, cache_size=100):
    """Fast persistence of an arbitrary Python object into a files, with
    dedicated storage for numpy arrays.

    Parameters
    -----------
    value: any Python object
        The object to store to disk
    filename: string
        The name of the file in which it is to be stored
    compress: integer for 0 to 9, optional
        Optional compression level for the data. 0 is no compression.
        Higher means more compression, but also slower read and
        write times. Using a value of 3 is often a good compromise.
        See the notes for more details.
    cache_size: positive number, optional
        Fixes the order of magnitude (in megabytes) of the cache used
        for in-memory compression. Note that this is just an order of
        magnitude estimate and that for big arrays, the code will go
        over this value at dump and at load time.

    Returns
    -------
    filenames: list of strings
        The list of file names in which the data is stored. If
        compress is false, each array is stored in a different file.

    See Also
    --------
    joblib.load : corresponding loader

    Notes
    -----
    Memmapping on load cannot be used for compressed files. Thus
    using compression can significantly slow down loading. In
    addition, compressed files take extra extra memory during
    dump and load.
