class Parallel(Logger):
    ''' Helper class for readable parallel mapping.

        Parameters
        -----------
        n_jobs: int, default: 1
            The maximum number of concurrently running jobs, such as the number
            of Python worker processes when backend="multiprocessing"
            or the size of the thread-pool when backend="threading".
            If -1 all CPUs are used. If 1 is given, no parallel computing code
            is used at all, which is useful for debugging. For n_jobs below -1,
            (n_cpus + 1 + n_jobs) are used. Thus for n_jobs = -2, all
            CPUs but one are used.
        backend: str or None, default: 'multiprocessing'
            Specify the parallelization backend implementation.
            Supported backends are:
              - "multiprocessing" used by default, can induce some
                communication and memory overhead when exchanging input and
                output data with the with the worker Python processes.
              - "threading" is a very low-overhead backend but it suffers
                from the Python Global Interpreter Lock if the called function
                relies a lot on Python objects. "threading" is mostly useful
                when the execution bottleneck is a compiled extension that
                explicitly releases the GIL (for instance a Cython loop wrapped
                in a "with nogil" block or an expensive call to a library such
                as NumPy).
        verbose: int, optional
            The verbosity level: if non zero, progress messages are
            printed. Above 50, the output is sent to stdout.
            The frequency of the messages increases with the verbosity level.
            If it more than 10, all iterations are reported.
        pre_dispatch: {'all', integer, or expression, as in '3*n_jobs'}
            The number of batches (of tasks) to be pre-dispatched.
            Default is '2*n_jobs'. When batch_size="auto" this is reasonable
            default and the multiprocessing workers shoud never starve.
        batch_size: int or 'auto', default: 'auto'
            The number of atomic tasks to dispatch at once to each
            worker. When individual evaluations are very fast, multiprocessing
            can be slower than sequential computation because of the overhead.
            Batching fast computations together can mitigate this.
            The ``'auto'`` strategy keeps track of the time it takes for a batch
            to complete, and dynamically adjusts the batch size to keep the time
            on the order of half a second, using a heuristic. The initial batch
            size is 1.
            ``batch_size="auto"`` with ``backend="threading"`` will dispatch
            batches of a single task at a time as the threading backend has
            very little overhead and using larger batch size has not proved to
            bring any gain in that case.
        temp_folder: str, optional
            Folder to be used by the pool for memmaping large arrays
            for sharing memory with worker processes. If None, this will try in
            order:
            - a folder pointed by the JOBLIB_TEMP_FOLDER environment variable,
            - /dev/shm if the folder exists and is writable: this is a RAMdisk
              filesystem available by default on modern Linux distributions,
            - the default system temporary folder that can be overridden
              with TMP, TMPDIR or TEMP environment variables, typically /tmp
              under Unix operating systems.
            Only active when backend="multiprocessing".
        max_nbytes int, str, or None, optional, 1M by default
            Threshold on the size of arrays passed to the workers that
            triggers automated memory mapping in temp_folder. Can be an int
            in Bytes, or a human-readable string, e.g., '1M' for 1 megabyte.
            Use None to disable memmaping of large arrays.
            Only active when backend="multiprocessing".

        Notes
        -----

        This object uses the multiprocessing module to compute in
        parallel the application of a function to many different
        arguments. The main functionality it brings in addition to
        using the raw multiprocessing API are (see examples for details):

            * More readable code, in particular since it avoids
              constructing list of arguments.

            * Easier debugging:
                - informative tracebacks even when the error happens on
                  the client side
                - using 'n_jobs=1' enables to turn off parallel computing
                  for debugging without changing the codepath
                - early capture of pickling errors

            * An optional progress meter.

            * Interruption of multiprocesses jobs with 'Ctrl-C'

            * Flexible pickling control for the communication to and from
              the worker processes.

            * Ability to use shared memory efficiently with worker
              processes for large numpy-based datastructures.

        Examples
        --------

        A simple example:

        >>> from math import sqrt
        >>> from joblib import Parallel, delayed
        >>> Parallel(n_jobs=1)(delayed(sqrt)(i**2) for i in range(10))
        [0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0]

        Reshaping the output when the function has several return
        values:

        >>> from math import modf
        >>> from joblib import Parallel, delayed
        >>> r = Parallel(n_jobs=1)(delayed(modf)(i/2.) for i in range(10))
        >>> res, i = zip(*r)
        >>> res
        (0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5)
        >>> i
        (0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 2.0, 3.0, 3.0, 4.0, 4.0)

        The progress meter: the higher the value of `verbose`, the more
        messages::

            >>> from time import sleep
            >>> from joblib import Parallel, delayed
            >>> r = Parallel(n_jobs=2, verbose=5)(delayed(sleep)(.1) for _ in range(10)) #doctest: +SKIP

            [Parallel(n_jobs=2)]: Done  10 out of  10 | elapsed:    0.5s finished

        Traceback example, note how the line of the error is indicated
        as well as the values of the parameter passed to the function that
        triggered the exception, even though the traceback happens in the
        child process::

         >>> from heapq import nlargest
         >>> from joblib import Parallel, delayed
         >>> Parallel(n_jobs=2)(delayed(nlargest)(2, n) for n in (range(4), 'abcde', 3)) #doctest: +SKIP
