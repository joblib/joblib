## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security vulnerabilities by opening a new [GitHub security
advisory](https://github.com/joblib/joblib/security/advisories/new).

You can also send an email to `joblib-security@scikit-learn.org`, which is an
alias to a subset of the joblib maintainers' team.

If the security vulnerability is accepted, a patch will be crafted privately
in order to prepare a dedicated bugfix release as timely as possible (depending
on the complexity of the fix).
