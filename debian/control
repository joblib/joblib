Description: tools to provide lightweight pipelining in Python
 Joblib is a set of tools to provide lightweight pipelining in
 Python. In particular, joblib offers:
 - transparent disk-caching of the output values and lazy
   re-evaluation (memoize pattern)
 - easy simple parallel computing
 - logging and tracing of the execution
 .
 Joblib is optimized to be fast and robust in particular on large,
 long-running functions and has specific optimizations for numpy arrays.
