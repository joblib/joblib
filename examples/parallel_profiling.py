================================================
Memory and CPU consumption using joblib.Parallel
================================================

This example illustrates some important aspects to keep in mind when using
:class:`joblib.Parallel`. We will focus on different patterns resulting in the
same outcomes but which trigger different internal behaviors. Those differences
will impact the memory consumption and computation time.

To illustrate those differences, the moving average from a large array will be
computed. Therefore, the average can be computed in parallel at different
locations of the data array.

# As a conclusion, the amount of memory used is reduced by passing the large
# array and sharing it between the workers, even if the coding pattern seems
# less intuitive. However, when looking at the execution time, this strategy is
# more time consuming. This due to the fact that internally, a hash of the
# shareable array will be computed to ensure that the data can be
# shared. However, computing a hash on a large amount of data is costly. The
# solution to avoid such checking is to manually memmap the input data and give
# it directly to :class:`joblib.Parallel`.

# The trend regarding the memory consumption is similar to the previous

# array into a memmap before to pass it to :class:`Parallel`, avoiding to make
# an unnecessary copy of the array.
