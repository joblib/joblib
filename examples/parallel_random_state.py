===================================
Random state within joblib.Parallel
===================================

Randomness is affected by parallel execution differently by the different
backends.

In particular, when using multiple processes, the random sequence can be
the same in all processes. This example illustrates the problem and shows
how to work around it.

# multiprocessing.

# %%
# Loky and the threading backends behave exactly as in the sequential case and
# do not require more care. However, this is not the case regarding the
# multiprocessing backend with the "fork" or "forkserver" start method because
# the state of the global numpy random stated will be exactly duplicated
# in all the workers
#
# Note: on platforms for which the default start method is "spawn", we do not
# have this problem but we cannot use this in a Python script without
# using the if __name__ == "__main__" construct. So let's end this example
# early if that's the case:

import multiprocessing as mp

# %%
# Some of the generated vectors are exactly the same, which can be a
# problem for the application.
#
# Technically, the reason is that all forked Python processes share the
# same exact random seed. As a result, we obtain twice the same randomly
# generated vectors because we are using ``n_jobs=2``. A solution is to
# set the random state within the function which is passed to
# :class:`joblib.Parallel`.

# ``stochastic_function_seeded`` accepts as argument a random seed. We can
# reset this seed by passing ``None`` at every function call. In this case, we
# see that the generated vectors are all different.

#########################################################

# allows to control the random_state by passing a known seed. So for instance,
# we can replicate the same generation of vectors by passing a fixed state as
# follows.
